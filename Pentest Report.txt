2. Tools & Methodology:
- Burp Suite: Manual and automated web application testing.
- Nikto: Web server vulnerability scanning.
- OWASP ZAP: Passive and active vulnerability scanning.
- Lynis: Operating system-level security auditing.
- Fail2Ban: Intrusion prevention and brute-force protection.

3. Vulnerabilities Identified and Mitigated:

| # | Vulnerability                | Tool Used     | Risk Level | Status     | Mitigation |
|---|------------------------------|---------------|------------|------------|------------|
| 1 | Missing Security Headers     | Burp Suite    | Medium     | Mitigated  | Added HSTS, CSP, X-Frame-Options |
| 2 | SQL Injection in Login       | Burp Suite    | High       | Mitigated  | Implemented parameterized queries |
| 3 | Cross-Site Request Forgery   | Burp Suite    | High       | Mitigated  | Added `csurf` middleware |
| 4 | No Rate Limiting             | Manual Review | High       | Mitigated  | Configured `express-rate-limit` |
| 5 | Insecure Cookies             | Burp Suite    | Medium     | Mitigated  | Applied `HttpOnly` and `Secure` flags |
| 6 | Outdated Dependencies        | NPM Audit     | Medium     | Mitigated  | Updated all packages |
| 7 | OS Configuration Weaknesses | Lynis         | Medium     | Mitigated  | Applied recommended hardening settings |
| 8 | Brute Force Vulnerability    | Manual        | High       | Mitigated  | Deployed Fail2Ban with custom filters |

4. Security Improvements:
- Implemented security headers (HSTS, CSP, X-XSS-Protection, X-Content-Type-Options)
- Enabled CSRF protection for all critical routes using `csurf` middleware
- Applied API rate limiting using `express-rate-limit`
- Hardened the operating system using Lynis recommendations
- Configured Fail2Ban for intrusion prevention against brute-force attacks
- Enhanced cookie security using `Secure`, `HttpOnly`, and `SameSite` attributes
- Updated all NPM packages to their latest secure versions
